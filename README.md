### Reflection 1

I applied some of the clean code principles that are being taught in the class such as meaningful naming conventions, ensuring that variable like productID will done its job as the ID of the product. I also followed the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by separating concerns between the controller, service, and repository layers. Additionally, I reduced code duplication by reusing logic in service and repository methods. I also implement secure coding practices that are introduced in the class, I implemented confirmation prompts for delete actions. I identified areas for improvement, such as adding input validation using annotations like @NotNull and @Size, and improving error handling with custom error pages. I also plan to enhance security by adding authorization checks to prevent unauthorized access to edit or delete endpoints.
